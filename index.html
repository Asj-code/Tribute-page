        <b>Jane Austen</b> (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often
        explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century
        literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.

          >Emma</a> (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, <a

          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanditon" target="_blank">Sanditon</a>, but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short epistolary novel <a

        published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.
